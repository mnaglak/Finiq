    "Name":"House of the Two Peristyles",
    "Date":"3rd century BCE",
    "Description":"A residential structure built on a terrace around 3 meters above the street level. The interior of the house was organized around two courtyards and occupied two floors. The remains of wall frescoes and colonnaded porticoes suggest the house was richly decorated. Along the street level, below the main terrace, were commericial spaces, perhaps shop fronts.",
    "More":"The structure was excavated intermittently between 1989 and 2002 and serves as the best documented example of private, residential building in Finiq. It possesses a rectangular plan occupying a footprint of ca. 31 x 25.5 m distributed over two terraced levels. The terrace upon which the main sector of the house rests was formed by levelling the natural bedrock of the hillside. Architecturally, the house is organized around two peristyles, or open courtyards with colonnaded porticoes, which serve to anchor two distinct sectors of the house.\nThe larger of the two peristyles occupies the northwest portion of the house and is accessed by the house’s main entrance, accessed via a stairway from the street level below. Its unroofed portion featured a pebble pavement and was delimited by large, white limestone blocks. Imprints on these blocks suggest the peristyle featured 16 columns, supporting a portico. Three rooms were arranged along the northeast side of the peristyle, one of which preserves remains wall paintings. These were probably used for receiving guests and would have been richly decorated. The peristyle is also connected with four rooms to its northwest, one of which would have served as a secondary entrance to the house. The largest of these four rooms is poorly preserved, as the portion of the terrace supporting it has largely eroded way. The smallest of the four rooms, in the northern corner of the house, was probably a stairway. Small ionic columns found in the peristyle belonged to an upper loggia sitting over the portico, proving the presence of an upper story. The layout of this upper floor, however, is unknown. \nThe smaller peristyle, occupying the southeast portion of the house, was accessed from the larger peristyle via a single doorway. It connected with two rooms on its northeastern side and featured 8 columns, remains of which are still visible. This portion of the house, which is architecturally isolated from the sector accessed directly via the two street entrances, might have been used for utilitarian purposes such as cooking, small-scale production, or storage.\nAlong the southwest flank of the structure and occupying the lower of the terraced levels are three rooms built during a second phase of the house. These spaces were not directly connected with the rest of the structure, at least not via the street level, and almost certainly held shops or other commercial spaces. Above these rooms might have been additional spaces built at the level of the upper terrace and connecting with the house’s two peristyles. \nThe house continued to be occupied through the mid-Imperial Roman period and received later modifications. The frescoes in the room near the large peristyle, for example, were almost certainly restored during the Roman period",
    "Hist":"The arrangement of residential buildings around a single peristyle was a typical element of Hellenistic architecture. The presence of two peristyles in a single structure, meanwhile, was less common. Important examples pre-dating the House of the Two Peristyles can be found in the royal palaces of Macedonian cities like Pella and Vergina. At Vergina, for example, the 4th century BCE palace, much like the House of the Two Peristyles, featured two peristyles of varied size, the smaller of which served utilitarian purposes. \n        The significance of the double-peristyle layout might be related to the segregation of spaces for men and women in the Greek household, a practice suggested by the writings of ancient authors like Plato, Lysias, Xenophon, and Vitruvius. Greek houses are often thought to have possessed an andron (a room or rooms dedicated to traditionally masculine activities, such as symposia, or drinking parties, and the reception of guests) and a gynaeceum (a room or rooms dedicated to traditionally feminine activities, such as weaving, cooking, or other domestic tasks). In the House of the Two Peristyles, the three decorated rooms on the northeastern side of the large peristyle might have served as an andron, while the sector of the house organized around the smaller peristyle, which is largely hidden from the other half of the residence, might have been a gynaeceum. On the other hand, some researchers have questioned whether a strict duality between masculine and feminine spaces really existed in Greek households, arguing that the information reported in ancient written texts should not be interpreted literally. Whatever the significance of the double-peristyle layout, the strict spatial division between the two sectors of the house, connected only by a single doorway, is highly suggestive of a functional differentiation.  \n        To date, the House of the Two Peristyles provides the best documented evidence for private residential spaces in the settlement of Finiq. More recently, this information has been supplemented by excavations of the House of the Frescoes, located further northeast along the ridge. In general, residential building at Finiq seemed to have been concentrated along the eastern sector of the hilltop, probably extending all the way down to the plane below over a series of terraced plots. Along with much of the public monumental building in the western part of the settlement, the private houses of Finiq were likely the product of a wave of urbanization during the Hellenistic period which saw the city emerge one of the most affluent centers of Epirus.
