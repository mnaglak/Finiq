                "Descriptio": "A public theater built in the Greek style during the 3rd century BCE and forming an essential part of the Hellenistic city’s monumental urban core. The theater is impressive in size, one of the largest in the territory of Epirus, and could have seated as many as 12,000 spectators for plays and other public events. Built into a natural depression of the hillside, its spectators would have been treated to a stunning view of the valley below. The theater consisted of a seating area (or <i>cavea</i>), below which sat the semicircular <i>orchestra</i> (the traditional performance space in Greek theaters), a raised stage area (<i>logeion</i>), and a monumental architectonic backdrop behind the stage area (the <i>skēnē</i>) accessed by two <i>parodoi</i>, or walkways. Ongoing archaeological excavations over the past two decades show that the theater was built in three main phases between the 3rd century BCE and the 4th century CE, when it was partially reconstructed in Roman brickwork after being severely damaged, perhaps by an earthquake. Its original construction belongs to the wave of urbanization the city witnessed in the Hellenistic period. Its continued use by local inhabitants over several centuries is a testament to the essential role of theaters in the civic and social identity of ancient Greek settlements.",

                "Descriptio": "A residential structure with a rectangular plan (about 31 x 25.5 m) built on a terrace around 3 meters above the street level. The interior of the house was organized around two peristyles, or open courtyards with colonnaded porticoes, and occupied two floors. The remains of wall frescoes and colonnaded porticoes suggest the portion of the  house situated around the larger courtyard, accessed directly via its main entrance, was richly decorated. This section of the house was probably used for the reception of guests, whereas the portion around the smaller courtyard seems to have been used for cooking, storage, and other utilitarian purposes. Along the street level below the main terrace were commercial spaces, perhaps shop fronts. The structure was excavated intermittently between 1989 and 2002 and serves as the best documented example of a private residential building in Phoenike. Along with the House of the Frescoes, the House of the Two Peristyles suggests that the western portion of Phoenike’s hilltop summit held the city’s residential zone, with the monumental public area (including the theater, <i>agora</i>, baths, and <i>stoa</i>) being concentrated toward the east.",

Only partially excavated and the subject of ongoing investigations, the baths take the form of a series of rooms built in alignment with the southeastern corner of a large, Hellenistic-era cistern. The central room is a rectangular space accessed via a long corridor. Inside the room were benches and a pavement which was elevated with a series of small, circular brick pillars (<i>suspensurae</i>). The empty space beneath the room (a <i>hypocaust</i>) served as a furnace for heating the room. Hot air would have radiated directly from the floor and circulated through channels inside the wall lined with ceramic tiles (<i>tegulae mammatae</i>) discovered <i>in situ</i>. This thermal room was also fitted with piping for running water and probably functioned as a sauna. The water was almost certainly sourced from the adjacent cistern, since no natural springs were available in the nearby area. Other rooms connected with the baths have been discovered and are the subject of ongoing investigations. On the basis of the materials and techniques used to construct the baths, they belong to the Roman phase of the settlement. Public baths were frequently built near the central square (<i>agora</i>) of Greek cities during the Roman period; a similar structure has been documented in nearby Byllis, dating to the 5th century CE. Phoenike’s baths, which might also have shared a connection with the neighboring theater, would have been part of the larger Roman re-monumentalization of the city’s urban core.",

                "Descriptio": "A small Hellenistic temple with a rectangular plan (4.5x3.2 m) constructed in large, finely squared blocks (<i>opus quadratum</i>) of local sandstone. The temple consists of a single main room (<i>naos</i>) and a porch (<i>pronaos</i>) framed by two square engaged columns (<i>antae</i>) and very likely featuring two additional Doric columns in the center. The walls of the interior portion of the temple were built directly into the bedrock of the hillside. A large open space unfolded in front of the temple, likely Phoenike’s  (<i>agora</i>), the public square that functioned as the center of social, civic, and religious life of Greek cities. Like other nearby structures, the temple belongs to the major phase of Hellensitic urbanization which saw the expansion and monumentalization of Phoenike’s public works. Its symbolic and sacred character was preserved in the Byzantine period (5th-6th centuries CE), when it was converted into a baptistery connected with the paleochristian basilica built adjacent to it in the (<i>agora</i>). The basilica - whose nave, transpet, and apse are arranged in the form of a Latin cross - would have been an important place of worship for the paleochristian community in the area. Phoenike was transformed into an episcopal see by the 5th century CE, and the basilica perhaps served as the local bishop’s cathedral. Along with the small church inserted in the nearby <i>stoa</i>, the basilica is one of two known paleochristian buildings in the settlement.",

The middle of these rooms takes the form of a <i>prostás</i>, an open room flanked by two columns which was a characteristic of many Greek houses. Like the House of the Two Peristyles, the House of the Frescoes conformed to the terracing and steep terrain of the city’s topography and probably used its lower street-level portion for commercial activities (suggested by the several pits found here for holding large jars, or <i>pithoi</i>, meant to store consumable goods).  On the main terrace, the house’s northernmost room was richly decorated in frescoed wall painting, providing some of the best evidence of its kind for the region of Epirus. The frescoes appear in the so-called “Masonry Style,” which used painted pigments to imitate marble wall paneling. This style was popular not only elsewhere in the Greek world, but also in the earliest frescoes found in Pompeii, and probably marked the room’s symbolic importance for hosting guests and drinking parties (<i>symposia</i>). The structure, excavated between 2012-2015 and the subject of ongoing research, is situated on the southern slopes of the western section of Phoenike’s long hilltop, occupying a relatively peripheral area compared to the majority of the currently documented buildings in the settlement.

                "Descriptio": "The defensive walls of Phoenike were among the first remains to be identified and investigated by Luigi Maria Ugolini. Constructed in various techniques, the city walls were built and expanded several times in order to encompass the entire settlement. While their precise dating has been the subject of archaeological debate for decades, the section of “cyclopean” walls (built in massive, roughly hewn boulders) visible near the modern entrance to the site are generally agreed to be the oldest, dating to at least the 4th century BCE. Nearby this section are also the so-called “Grand Bastion” and “<i>Laurus Nobilis</i>” gates, two of several distributed around its circuit and complemented by a series of bastions and walkways for added defense. From this location, the walls continue westward in a masonry that uses trapezoidal stones in varying dimensions, continuing down the hillside before turning eastward, running along the lower portion of the hillside and eventually wrapping back up the hill to complete the circuit. Today, most archaeologists agree that the walls were built in a piecemeal fashion, unlike those of nearby Antigone which were constructed in a single building technique. Their expansion and continued modification over time is evidence of Phoenike’s physical marked growth during the Hellenistic period, as well as its strategic importance in a region increasingly at the crossroads of power between the Roman Republic and the Hellenistic kingdom of Macedon.",

The area was established as a necropolis in the late 4th century BCE, monumentalized along the roadway in the 3rd-2nd centuries BCE, and continued well into the Roman period, finally going out of use in the 3rd century CE. The oldest of the tombs appear in the form of  <i>tumuli</i>, or circular mounds. Later tombs followed standard typologies, including the tapered <i>stele</i> marker sometimes decorated with painted depictions or reliefs, but also showed some variation. Standing out especially are the tombs along the roadway featuring monumental architectural facades, perhaps commemorating members of the city’s elite. Various funerary inscriptions in the Greek language were found throughout the necropolis, preserving the names and places of origin of some of the individuals buried in the area (some of whom had origins in Corsica, Sicily, or Italy). Several of the tombs also included grave goods ritually interred with the deceased, most often black gloss vessels and other tableware related to banquets and drinking parties (<i>symposia</i>). Anthropological analysis reveals that most of the dead interred in the necropolis were in decent health, showing few signs of labor-related stress, malnutrition, or other physical ailments. Many of the tombs were used and reused for several generations, pointing to a strong current of familial continuity in this sacred, monumental city burial ground. ",

The <i>stoa</i> of Phoenike (about 50x12 m) was located at the center of the city’s <i>agora</i>, or central public square, dividing it in two. Its main facade on its western side, consisting of a colonnade along 40 meters long terminating in recessed walls. This facade probably featured 17 doric columns supporting a monumental entablature. At the center of the eastern wall of the <i>stoa</i> was a large square space, functioning as an exhedra. An internal colonnade, made up of nine columns on square bases, servided to divide the interior of the <i>stoa</i> into two naves. The exterior walls of the building were reinforced with up to nine buttresses, of which the bottom portions remain, and featured monumental entrance ways for traffic moving from one side of the <i>agora</i> to the other. The <i>stoa</i> dates to the early 2nd century BCE, when Phoenike was the capital of the Epirote League, on the basis of coins discovered within the structure’s masonry during a foundation ritual for the construction project. Later on, in the 7th century CE, a small church was placed within the southern portion of the <i>stoa</i>, which had probably long since gone out of use. This church had a square plan with an apse, a presbytery, and a narthex. One of two Christian buildings dating to Phoenike’s Byzantine period, the small church seemed to have served an important funerary function, with countless burials inserted in its vicinity. These tombs date from the church’s foundation all the way to its final abandonment in the 16th century. ",
